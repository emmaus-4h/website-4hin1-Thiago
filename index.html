				On this website i'll try to teach you the basics of the card game: Yu-Gi-Oh!<br>
        
        
          I'll try to make it as easy as possible,so I'll explain the basic rules of the game <a href="Basics.html"> here, </a> and words that you'll have to look out for <a href="Keyword.htmls">here.</a><br><br>For now i'll tell you about tho origins of yu-Gi-Oh!<br>Yu-Gi-Oh! is the game played in the populair show and manga of the same name, of wich the first chapter was published from september 30th 1996 all the way to march 8th 2004, this run however did not featre just the cardgame, the opposite in fact, the card game only appeared in a couple of chapters. Later a new version of it was published, this one more cildfriendly and focused purely on the card game.<br>
          

   <p>The card game in the original show is different to that of the series that came after, or the actual game, this is because the original show didn't have a established ruleset of the game in the real worle, becuae they had yet to release it. Thanks to this they had to make up tjings as they went, because changing they way they played in the middle of the series would confuse the audience. The differences were that they could summon cards in face-up defence postion, and that cards just knda did whatever they wanted, such as <a href=#normalmonster>normal monsters</a> activating effects, or them attacking <a href=#fieldspell>field spells.</a> 
   <br>
   Starting from the second series the series would start focussing on the extra deck summoning mechanics, GX would focus on <a href="fusion">fusion summoning,</a> which was already a thing but here they would solidify the mechanic. After GX every serie would introduce a new mechanic, starting with <a href="synchro">synchro summoning</a> in 7d's, and then <a href=xyz>xyz summoning</a> in zexal. The first and so far only serie to introduce a main deck mechanic is arc-V, which would introduce <a href="pendulum">pendulum summoning.</a> And lastly we have VRains, which would introduce <a href="link">link summoning</a>
