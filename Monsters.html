        <p>The most important cards in your deck an extra deck will be your monsters, these are the cards that you'll summon and use to attack, and nowadays they'll also have some incredible effects which could help you in various ways, such as special summoning, negating attacks or effects and sometimes they even allow to draw cards, but what kind of monsters are there?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>The Main Deck</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Normal Monsters</h3>
        <p>The most straightforward of monsters, they don't have any effects, but in exchange, they'll often have high attack or defense. One rule that applies for all main deck monsters is that you can normal summon them only if they have four or less stars, you'll have to tribute one monster to summon a level five or six monster, and two for anything else, unless stated otherwise</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Effect Monsters</h3>
        <p>Basically the same as normal monsters, the only difference being that they have all kinds of effects, which all differ</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Pendulum Monsters</h3>
        <p>Pendulum monsters are monsters which are part spell card, which can only be activated in your right-most and left-most spell/trap zones, these cards have a numerical value on them, which indicate which level you can pendulum summon, if the numerical value of one is 3 and the value of the other is eight,you can pendulum summon monsters with levels from 4 through 7
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>The Extra Deck</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Fusion Monsters</h3>
        <p>Fusion monsters are cards which can be summoned by using a fusion card and sending the required materials from your hand or field to the graveyard
