                <p>Within the game of yugioh there are certain cards which interact with others in an interesting way, these cards can be quite confusing to understand as they do not follow standard procedure, here are some keywords you'll want to look out for;</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href=#When>When</a></li>
                  <li><a href=#if>if</a></li>
                  <li><a href=#cost>Costs</a></li>
                  <li><a href=#destroynegate>Destroying or Negating</a></li>

                  
                
                </ul>
                <h2>When</h2>
                <p id=When></p>
                <p>If a card say when something happens, it means it must be the first thing to activate after the requirements are met, this, however does not apply when an effect is mandatory. You can distuigish mandatory effects from optional effects quite easily, an effect like that of Tragoedia that says;<br> <span class=quote>When you take battle damage, you can special summon this card from your hand.</span>
                <br>
                Notice how it says that you <span class=accentuate>can</span> activate the effect, which means you don't have to, meanwhile, you have cards like Caius the Shadow Monarch which states;<br> <span class=quote>When this card is tribute summoned, target 1 card on the field; banish that target and if you so, inflict 1000 damage to your opponent.</span>
                <br>
                Notice how it doesn't say can, which means that if your opponent has no applicable target in his control; you'll have to banish one of your own cards. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 id=if>If</h2>
                Cards which say if something happens are different from effects that say when in the sense that they don't need to be the first thing to happen after the requirements are met, even going as far as to be able to start new<a href=#chains> chains,</a> even if they are optional effects. This kind of wording is
